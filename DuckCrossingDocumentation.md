## I. Requirements
1.  **Description of Problem**

        **Name**: Graphical Test Application

        Creation of a test application that makes use of my Maths classes.

        **Problem Specifications**:
        -   Impliments an example of Matrix Heirarchy to manipulate visible elements.
        -   Impliments an example of Gameobjects using velocity and acceleration with vectors
        -   Example of collision detection


2. **Input Information**

    'W' - Allows the player to move upwards on the Y-Axis when trying to move their character.

    'A' - Allows the player to move downwards on the Y-Axis when trying to move their character.

    'S' - Allows the player to move to the right on the X-Axis when trying to move their character.

    'D' - Allows the player to move to the left on the X-Axis when trying to move their character.

    'Left-Shift' - Allows the player to increase their speed, giving the illusion of running.
3. **Output Information**

4. **User Interface information**

    - UI displays instructions as a renminder of how to play and it also displays how many children the Player Gameobject contains, indicating the amount of chicks the player has already collected.

## II. Design

1. _System architecture_

    Every object in every scene derives from an Actor class, placed into an Actor array and placed inside the an instance if the Scene class itself, rather than having more than one scene in the engine class alone. 

2. _Object Information_ 

    - **Filename**: 
        - Name:
        - Visibility:
